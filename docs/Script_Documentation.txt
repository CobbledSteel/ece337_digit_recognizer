WARNING make_concat.sh MUST BE USED TO COMPILE AND RUN THE DIGIT_RECOGNIZER
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
USE OF: make_concat.sh

The script file make_concat.sh has two options available to it.

1. make_concat.sh source

	concatenates all module files into a
	single digit_recognizer_final.sv

	runs associated test bench on source
	version of digit_recognizer_final
	
2. make_concat.sh mapped

	dumps previously the previously 
	created mapped file and re-synthesizes
	based on makefile parameters
	
	concatenates all module files into a
	single digit_recognizer_final.sv
	
	runs associated test bench on mapped
	version of digit_recognizer_final
	
	after questasim is closed, pads are
	added to digit_recognizer_final
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////	
ONCE TEST BENCH HAS BEEN OPENED

1. Type the command
	For the source test bench (add waves and associated properties)
	a. do wave_source.do
	For the mapped test bench (add waves and associated properties)
	b. do wave_mapped.do
	
2. Specify test_count variable

    The number of test images to be run on our digit recognizer can
	be specified up to 10,000 images.
	
	To change the test count
	
	force test_count <image vector size>
	
3. Specify test option

	There are three different test options that can be run within our
	test bench.
	
	1. Option 0 (Default)
	
		Runs the digit recognizer purely on handwritten digit input
		and outputs the associated digit value that the network
		believes is correct
		
	2. Option 1
	
		Runs the digit recognizer purely on handwritten digit input
		and outputs the associated digit value that the network
		believes is correct
		
		Runs the digit recognizer for each of the above digits to
		determine the cost of each operation. The test bench shows
		both the actual cost output and the expected cost.
		
	3. Option 2
	
		Runs the digit recognizer to test for error codes based on
		the SPI controllers. If a value is requested too early, the
		error code should be 255 (0xFF).
		
	To change any option use the command in the transcript of the test bench
	
	force option <option number>
